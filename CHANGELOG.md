# Changelog

All notable changes to ApplyPilot will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Parallel workers for discovery/enrichment** — `applypilot run --workers N` enables
  ThreadPoolExecutor-based parallelism for Workday scraping, smart extract, and detail
  enrichment. Default is sequential (1); power users can scale up.
- **Apply utility modes** — `--gen` (generate prompt for manual debugging), `--mark-applied`,
  `--mark-failed`, `--reset-failed` flags on `applypilot apply`
- **Dry-run mode** — `applypilot apply --dry-run` fills forms without clicking Submit
- **5 new tracking columns** — `agent_id`, `last_attempted_at`, `apply_duration_ms`,
  `apply_task_id`, `verification_confidence` for better apply-stage observability
- **Manual ATS detection** — `manual_ats` list in `config/sites.yaml` skips sites with
  unsolvable CAPTCHAs (e.g. TCS iBegin)
- **Qwen3 `/no_think` optimization** — automatically saves tokens when using Qwen models
- **`config.DEFAULTS`** — centralized dict for magic numbers (`min_score`, `max_apply_attempts`,
  `poll_interval`, `apply_timeout`, `viewport`)

### Changed
- **Blocked sites externalized** — moved from hardcoded sets in launcher.py to
  `config/sites.yaml` under `blocked:` key
- **Site base URLs externalized** — moved from hardcoded dict in detail.py to
  `config/sites.yaml` under `base_urls:` key
- **SSO domains externalized** — moved from hardcoded list in prompt.py to
  `config/sites.yaml` under `blocked_sso:` key
- **Prompt improvements** — screening context uses `target_role` from profile,
  salary section includes `currency_conversion_note` and dynamic hourly rate examples
- **`acquire_job()` fixed** — writes `agent_id` and `last_attempted_at` to proper columns
  instead of misusing `apply_error`
- **`profile.example.json`** — added `currency_conversion_note` and `target_role` fields
